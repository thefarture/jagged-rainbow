  the goal of this project is to create a basic working website for band to show clients as a media package, or electronic press kit (EPK). content should include pictures of the band, optional background audio with control icon layered on as 2d next to the VR icon. Need social medio icon buttons, same format, maybe bottom left oriented. typical format for band, I guess. 

  videos
  recordings
  contact
  merch         look into weird options for this. needs to link to something. 

  left alligned wouldn't look bad, main menu. consider using react or some such library for 2d. but why not just basic css? start simple at this point. lets weave in these different libraries one at a time.

  must be auto-formatting to any device. keep things simple and sleek. do that first, then get weird at this point.
